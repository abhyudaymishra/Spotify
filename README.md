Spotify was founded in April 2006 as a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider. It is the world's largest provider of music streaming services, with over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paid subscribers.

We'll look at and quantify data about music to gain valuable insights.

Using Python, conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualisation project with Spotify data.

Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary Spotify data. Data will be used by students to identify patterns and relationships between various characteristics. The activity will help students improve their ability to review and interpret data. The activity begins by encouraging students to consider questions that the dataset might answer, thereby developing their "problem solving" skills. After analysing the dataset, learners will be able to reorganise and restructure the data to help them answer their questions.
